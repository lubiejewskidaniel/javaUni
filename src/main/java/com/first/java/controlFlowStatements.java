    Control Flow Statements
    Java has several control flow statements that allow you to control the flow 
    of execution in your program. These include:
    - if/else statements: used to make decisions based on a condition
    - for loops: used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times
    - while loops: used to repeat a block of code while a condition is true
    - switch statements: used to choose between several options based on a value

Here is an example of an if/else statement in Java:

int myNumber = 42;

if (myNumber > 0) {
    System.out.println("The number is positive.");
} else if (myNumber < 0) {
    System.out.println("The number is negative.");
} else {
    System.out.println("The number is zero.");
}
In this example, we check if the variable "myNumber" is greater than 0. 
If it is, we print the message "The number is positive.". If it is not, 
we check if it is less than 0. If it is, we print the message 
"The number is negative.". If it is neither greater than nor less than 0, 
we print the message "The number is zero.".
