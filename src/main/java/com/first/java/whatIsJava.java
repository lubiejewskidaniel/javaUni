    What is Java?
    Java is a general-purpose programming language that was created in 1995 by 
    Sun Microsystems. It is an object-oriented language that is designed to be 
    platform-independent, which means that Java code can run on any device or 
    operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.
