    What is Java?
    Java is a general-purpose programming language that was created in 1995 
    by Sun Microsystems. It is an object-oriented language that is designed 
    to be platform-independent, which means that Java code can run on any 
    device or operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.
